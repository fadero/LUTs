# LUTs
Look-up tables for ImageJ/FIJI

In this repository are custom look-up tables that Iâ€™ve created to aid in data visualization. The custom LUTs were created using the LUT Editor created by Kevin (Gali) Baler, available here: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/lut-editor.html.

A .lut file can be installed in ImageJ or in FIJI by dragging the file into the menu bar or by copying the file into the luts folder in your local ImageJ/FIJI install.
